My Favorite series as of now is **Daredevil: Born Again** 

It became my favorite because of its deep realism, powerful characters, and intense action. I love how **Charlie Cox’s** portrayal of *Matt Murdock* shows both the hero’s moral struggles and human flaws, making him feel real and relatable. Combined with gritty, well-choreographed fight scenes and authentic storytelling, the series captures the essence of justice and survival that me and the fans admire.
